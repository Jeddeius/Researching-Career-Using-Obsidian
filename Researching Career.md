**Purpose:** To have a SMART goals (Sustainable, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time Bound). To be realistic about careers. To gain knowledge about the world of jobs and careers (Getting the Job, Doing the Job, Keeping the Job, Practical Stuff)

**Everything You Need to Know Before Starting Engineering** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z4wUKBkD94

1. **Not all Engineering Job is the Same:** Some is sucking, some is fulfilling. If you don't like job, leave
2. **It's Normal to Doubt:** Do some things in life GetALife
3. **Won't Make you Rich:** Depends on where you work. You can apply to different professions
4. **Project Expectation vs Reality:** Doensn't involved any designing. These are paper pushing (there are startups, etc.)
	1. Documentation
	2. Creating Drawings
	3. Figuring out where & how to place brackets
	4.   Pulling new part numbers
	5. Making sure design has no negative effects
	6. Reloading everything when CAD crashes
	7. Filling out Engineering Change Orders (ECOs)
	8. Updating BOMs (Bill of Materials)
5. **Types of Engineering**
	1. Money Students, Math/Science Students, The "Actual" Engineers
6. **Problem Solving Skills in Engineering** Work SMART
7. **Network and Talk to People:** Make Friends as much as possible. Need to be Social.
8. **Review outside class**
9. **INTERNSHIP:** (unless you get a research-based job). Best way to learn. If time is not spent on school, do internships

**Weaknesses:** Lack Social Skills (Badly Needed for Opportunities) and Connection to Other People. Respect from other people.

The Weaknesses is still the same, we need to make friends with other people
